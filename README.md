🚀 Project Title & Tagline
--------------------------------

**Project Title:** Exploring Python Fundamentals
**Tagline:** A collection of Python scripts to learn and practice the basics of Python programming.

📖 Description
----------------

This project is a compilation of various Python scripts that demonstrate the fundamental concepts of Python programming. The scripts cover topics such as list slicing, nested statements, sets, data types, object-oriented programming, logical operators, string functions, and more. The project is designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers learn and practice the basics of Python programming.

✨ Features
------------

1. **List Slicing**: Demonstrates how to slice lists in Python.
2. **Nested Statements**: Shows how to use nested if-else statements in Python.
3. **Sets**: Introduces how to create and manipulate sets in Python.
4. **Data Types**: Explains the different data types in Python, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
5. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Provides an introduction to object-oriented programming in Python, including classes and objects.
6. **Logical Operators**: Demonstrates how to use logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not` in Python.
7. **String Functions**: Shows how to use various string functions such as `len()`, `startswith()`, and `split()` in Python.
8. **Tuples**: Introduces how to create and manipulate tuples in Python.
9. **Modules**: Demonstrates how to create and use Python modules.
10. **Functions**: Shows how to define and use functions in Python.

📁 Project Structure
--------------------

The project consists of 14 Python files, each demonstrating a specific concept or feature. The files are organized into the following folders:

* `basic_concepts`: Files that demonstrate basic concepts such as list slicing, sets, and data types.
* `object_oriented_programming`: Files that demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and objects.
* `functions`: Files that demonstrate how to define and use functions in Python.
* `modules`: Files that demonstrate how to create and use Python modules.

⚙️ How to Run
